# IMAGE-CAPTIONING
generating captions for the images using cnn
Project Statement
Outcome of this project is image captioning based on which it helps
people to understand the caption of images. Making a computer system detect
objects and describe them using natural language processing (NLP) in an age-
old problem of Artificial Intelligence. Our model is based on a deep learning
neural network that consists of a vision CNN and LSTM with Python. It
generates complete sentences as an output.
I. INTRODUCTION
Image captioning is a computer vision and natural language processing
task that involves generating a textual description of the content of an image.
The goal of image captioning is to create a system that can automatically produce
human-like captions for images, which can be used in a variety of applications,
such as visual aid for the visually impaired, image search engines, and content-
based image retrieval systems.
The process of image captioning involves two main components: an
image encoder and a language decoder. The image encoder is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) that processes the input image and generates a feature
representation that captures the visual content of the image. The language
decoder is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that takes the feature
representation generated by the image encoder as input and generates a
sequence of words that describe the image.
Image captioning is a challenging task that requires the system to
understand both the visual content of the image and the semantics of natural
language. Recent advances in deep learning and computer vision have led to
significant progress in the field of image captioning, and state-of-the-art models
are now able to generate captions that are comparable in quality to those written
by humans.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/529b16b2-4b52-4d41-a1b8-1857ffe1f585)
